Movement:

	A character may move any distance they want on their initiative
	counts as long as their total movement during the round does not exceed their
	maximum.


Critical fray

	Critical success in fray rolls in melee allows the defender to gain +10 on their next hit.

-Melee-

Feinting:
	
	Characters fighting in close combat may attempt to make their strike more
	difficult to avoid. The attacker may "feint" as a Called Shot to force the
	defender to use 3/4 of their Fray or Melee combat skill to defend against the
	attack roll.  This makes the attacker subject to a -10 penalty to their attack,
	as per Called Shot rules (EP, p.197).  Feinting requires a Quick Action to
	execute the necessary footwork required to confound the opponent.

Extra Melee Weapons:

	In the use of two or more melee weapons, the first weapon attacks as normal, the second at a -20 penalty, and subsequent attacks at -30, -40, -50 etc.
	Armor reduces damage before the calculation is make.
	Attack # | Damage modifier
	   1     | 1
	   2     | 1/2

Weapon Sets:
	
	Melee weapons which could be used as a set such as gloves are purchased as single items, and using more than one counts as using multiple weapons.

Disengaging:

	Moving out of melee range is a Quick Action, with the person trying to
	escape rolling Fray/Freerunning-20 vs the others Melee skill. If you fail,
	you not only don't go anywhere, but you take a free hit at half damage from
	the person you were trying to get away from.

	You can make it a complex action instead of a Quick Action to remove the
	-20 penalty without oppurtunity for a return attack.

Cumbersome Gear Rating:
	
	Some weapons have a -30 to hit if not properly braced.
	Aiming with Quick Action removes this penalty.
	Aiming with a complex action gives the next shot a +20 to hit.

Aiming

	You cannot aim ranged weapons in melee range.

Melee Weaponry:

Melee weapons have come a long way from their antecedents. Built of smart
materials and often containing dedicated AIs and sensor suites, modern melee
weapons can be more aptly described as weaponized disassembly systems, capable
of analysing whatever they're swung at and modifying themselves to maximize
their effectiveness.

Melee Weapons are available in three categories defined by their size, with
each category available in bladed, blunt or complex forms. The effects of each
weapon are defined by their category, as the advanced technologies they use
render their effects in combat roughly equivalent – their exact physical forms
are irrelevant, and largely a function of aesthetics. If desired, they can form
an internal canister to hold chemicals, drugs or nanobots, which can be set to
release either on contact or when the target is damaged.

	Light Weapons

		Weapons which fall in the “Light” category are generally small or
		simple, and many carry at least one on their person.
		Knives are the most usual example of Light Bladed Weapons, and Light
		Blunt Weapons include small clubs and the batons carried by security
		forces. Light Complex Weapons usually take the form of smartmaterial
		clothing, such as self-hardening gloves, shoe spikes or bladed
		hat-rims.

		Armor Penetration (AP): 0 Damage Value (DV): 1d10 + (SOM/10) Average
		DV: 5 + (SOM/10) Cost: [Trivial] Palming tests to conceal Light weapons
		get a +20 bonus. When making an attack with a Light weapon the wielder
		gains either a +10 bonus to hit, or may increase the DV by 1d10.

	Standard Weapons

		What one usually thinks of when picturing melee weaponry, Standard
		weapons are wielded with one-hand. Standard Bladed weapons include
		sabres, rapiers and hatchets, whilst hammers and maces make up the bulk
		of Standard Blunt weapons. Whips and chains are the most popular forms
		of Standard Complex weapon, often equipped with systems similar to
		those found in electronic rope to prevent self-injury.

		Armor Penetration (AP): -2 Damage Value (DV): 2d10 + 2 + (SOM/10)
		Average DV 13 + (SOM/10) Cost: [Trivial] When making an attack with a
		Standard weapon the wielder gains either a +10 bonus to hit, or may
		increase the DV by 1d10.

	Heavy Weapons

		Heavy weapons are large weapons which must be wielded with two hands.
		Longswords and Claymores are popular versions of the Heavy Bladed
		category, and most habitats will have Heavy Axes available for fire or
		emergency purposes. Heavy Blunt weapons such as hammers can often be
		found in the hands of gang enforcers to make them more intimidating,
		and staves are beloved by those who take a more mystical or spiritual
		approach to transhuman existence.
		Heavy Complex weapons are exceedingly rare, the most notorious of which
		being the smart-fibre garrotte.

		Armor Penetration (AP): -6 Damage Value (DV): 2d10 +6 + (SOM/10)
		Average DV: 15 + (SOM/10) Cost: [Trivial] When making an attack with a
		Heavy weapon the wielder gains either a +10 bonus to hit, or may
		increase the DV by 1d10. Characters attempting to use Heavy weapons
		with one hand do not get this bonus.

Modifications: Almost all modern melee weapons are equipped with at least one
of the following modifications, and it isn't uncommon for a weapon to possess
more, although such weapons are usually found in the hands of specialists. To
determine the price of a modified weapon, simply add the cost of the weapon and
modifications together. The cost of the weapon's blueprint is determined in the
same manner.

	Non-lethal: These weapons are not intended to cause serious injury, and are
	often used a training implement or in sports. Non-lethal weapons with other
	modifications are often used by Security personnel or for self-defence.
	Non-lethal weapons gain -4 AP, but halve any damage dealt. [Trivial]

	Flex: The smartmaterials in this weapon are programmed to shift it's form to
	something more innocuous when activated, such such as a piece of clothing or
	briefcase. Activating this modification requires a Quick Action, which can be
	combined with the action to draw or holster the weapon. Security personnel and
	weapon scanners can only identify the true nature of these weapons if they
	score a critical success on a perception check. [Low]

	Mono-filament: Weapons with this modification are either honed to a
	monomolecular edge or have their striking surface covered with a
	monofilament mesh, easily capable of slicing through metal or limbs. Such
	weapons gain +2 AP, +2 DV, and attack rolls which score an Excellent Success
	automatically bypass armour. [Moderate]

	Vibro-: This modification equips the weapon with edged surfaces which vibrate
	at a high frequency for extra cutting ability. This has little extra effect
	when stabbing or slashing, but when carefully sawing through something or
	applying constant pressure with a blunt weapon, this provides an extra –3 AP
	and +2d10 damage. [Moderate]

	Shock: Weapons with this modification Shock targets they damage. (See EP. p204)
	[Moderate]

	Shredder: The smart materials in these weapons are programmed to reform into
	serrated barbs once the target has been struck to tear apart flesh and metal,
	then retract to ease retrieval. Attacks which deal damage deal an extra 1d10
	DV. [High]

	Render: This combination of the Vibro- and Shredder modifications was developed
	to attack armour, inducing fractures and tearing away nearby material. When
	this weapon strikes it's target it reduces it's kinetic armour value by 1d10/2.
	[Moderate]

	Plasma-Sheath: When activated this modification cloaks the weapon in a softly
	glowing plasma shell. Essentially an inbuilt bug-zapper, this plasma is much
	too weak to harm most morphs, but makes an effective countermeasure against
	nanoswarms.. Attacks made against nanoswarms or morphs with the Swarm
	Composition augmentation deal 1d10 DV, instead of the 1 DV usually dealt.
	[Moderate]



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FIRING MODES AND RATE OF FIRE
	Every ranged weapon in Eclipse Phase comes with one or more  ring modes that determines their rate of  re. These  ring modes are detailed below.

	SINGLE SHOT (SS)
	Single shot weapons may only be  red once per Complex Action. These are typically larger or more archaic devices.

	SEMI-AUTOMATIC (SA)
	Semi-automatic weapons are capable of quick, repeated  re. They may be  red twice with the same Complex Action. Each shot is handled as a separate attack.

	BURST FIRE (BF)
	Burst fired weapons release a number of quick shots (a “burst”) with a single trigger pull. Two bursts maybe fired with the same Complex Action. Each burst is handled as a separate attack. Bursts use up 3 shots worth of ammunition.
	A burst may be shot against a single target or against two targets who are standing within one meter of each other. In the case of concentrated fired against a single target, the attacker gains a +10 modifier to hit and increases the DV by +1d10.

	FULL AUTOMATIC (FA)
	Normal pistols dont get FA.
	Full-auto weapons release a hail of shots with a single trigger pull. Only one full-auto attack may be made with each Complex Action. This attack may be made on a single target or against up to three separate targets, as long as each is within one meter of another. In the case of concentrated  re on a single individual, the attacker can choose either a +30 modi er to hit or increase the DV by +3d10. Firing in full automatic mode uses up 10 shots.

Async Changes--Psi {{{
Psi Chi Sleights
Psi-chi sleights are async abilities that speed up cognitive informatics (internal information processing) and enhance the user’s perception and cognition.

Ambience Sense
Psi Type: Passive
Action: Automatic
Range: Self
Duration: Constant
This sleight provides the async with an instinctive sense about an area and any potential threats nearby. The async receives a +10 modifier to all Investigation, Perception, Scrounging, and Surprise Tests.

Downtime
Psi Type: Active
Action: Task (min. 4 hours)
Range: Self
Duration: Sustained
Strain Mod: 0
This sleight provides the async with the ability to send the mind into a fugue-state regenerative downtime, during which the character’s psyche is repaired. The async must enter the downtime for at least 4 hours; every 4 hours of downtime heals 1 point of stress damage. Traumas, derangements, and disorders are unaffected by this sleight. For all sensory purposes, the async is catatonic during downtime, completely oblivious to the outside world. Only severe disturbances or physical shock (such as being wounded or hit by a shock weapon) will bring the async out of it.

Eco-Empathy
Psi Type: Active
Action: Complex
Range: Self
Duration: Instant
Strain Mod: –1
An async with this sleight can attempt to gain an intuitive understanding of non-sentient, non-terrestrial organisms occupying a producer niche in the local ecosystem (e.g., alien plant and fungus analogues). If the character succeeds in a COG x 2 Test, they gain a basic understanding of the organism’s place in the local ecosystem, as well as whether it’s safe and nutritious for transhuman consumption. The information gained is of a general and qualitative nature and doesn’t include any data that would normally be gained by chemical or genetic analysis. For example, an eco-empathic async could tell that a given plant thrives only in riparian zones, relies on local insect analogs for pollination, and has tubers that become edible if well cooked. They would not be able to tell that the same plant has over a thousand chromosomes, that it exudes a chemical that is physically addicting to the insects, or that the tubers contain high concentrations of a toxic lectin that breaks down and becomes harmless if boiled.

Emotion Control
Psi Type: Passive
Action: Automatic
Range: Self
Duration: Constant
Strain: +0
Emotion Control gives the async tight control over their emotional states. Unwanted emotions can be blocked out and others embraced. This has the benefit of protecting the async from emotional manipulation, such as the Drive Emotion sleight or Intimidation skill tests. The async receives a +30 modifier when defending against such tests. Emotion Control has an active mode that gives +30 to Deception and Indimidation, and -10 to persuasion.

Enhanced Creativity
Psi Type: Passive
Action: Automatic
Range: Self
Duration: Constant
An async with Enhanced Creativity is more imaginative and more inclined to think outside the box. Apply a +20 modifier to any tests where creativity plays a major role. This level of ingenuity can sometimes seem strange and different, manifesting in odd or creepy ways, especially with artwork. Also grants +10 bonus to tests for having an idea.

Filter
Psi Type: Passive
Action: Automatic
Range: Self
Duration: Constant
Filter allows the async to filter out out distractions and eliminate negative situational modifiers from distraction, up to the gamemaster’s discretion.

Grok
Psi Type: Active
Action: Complex
Range: Self
Duration: Instant
Strain Mod: –1
By using the Grok sleight, the async is able to intuitively understand how any unfamiliar object, vehicle, or device is used simply by looking at and handling it. If the character succeeds in a COG x 2 Test, they achieve a basic ability to use the object, vehicle, or device, no matter how alien or bizarre. This sleight does not provide any understanding of the principles or technologies involved—the psi user simply grasps how to make it work. If a test is called for, the psi user receives a +20 modifier to use the device (this bonus only applies to unfamiliar devices, and/or tests the character is defaulting on—it does not apply to devices the character is familiar with).

High Pain Threshold
Psi Type: Passive
Action: Automatic
Range: Self
Duration: Constant
This sleight allows the async to block out, ignore, or otherwise isolate pain. The async reduces negative modifiers from wounds by 10.

Hyperthymesia
Psi Type: Passive
Action: Automatic
Range: Self
Duration: Constant
Hyperthymesia grants the async a superior autobiographical memory, allowing them to remember the most trivial of events. A hyperthymestic async can be asked a random date and recall the day of the week it was, the events that occurred that day, what the weather was like, and many seemingly trivial details that most people would not be able to recall. Gives recall on sight equivalent to mnemonic augments.

Instinct
Psi Type: Passive
Action: Automatic
Range: Self
Duration: Constant
Instinct bolsters the async’s subconscious ability to gauge a situation and make a snap judgment that is just as accurate as a careful, considered decision. For Task Actions that involve analysis or planning alone (typically Mental skill actions), the async may reduce the timeframe by 90% without suffering a modifier. For Task Actions that involve partial analysis/planning, they may reduce the timeframe by 30% without penalty.

Multitasking
Psi Type: Passive
Action: Automatic
Range: Self
Duration: Constant
The async can handle vast amounts of information without overload and can perform more than one mental task at once. The character receives two extra Complex Action each Action Phase that may only be used for mental or mesh actions.

Pattern Recognition
Psi Type: Passive
Action: Automatic
Range: Self
Duration: Constant
The character is adept at spotting patterns and correlating the non-random elements of a jumble—related items jump out at them. This is useful for translating languages, breaking codes, or find clues hidden among massive amounts of data. The character must have a sufficiently large sample enough time to study, as determined by the gamemaster. This might range from a few hours of listening to a spoken transhuman language to a few days of investigating inscriptions left by long-dead aliens to a week or more of researching a lengthy cipher. Languages may be comprehended by reading or listening to them being spoken. Apply a +20 modifier to any appropriate Language, Investigation, Research, or code-breaking Tests (note that this does not apply to Infosec Tests made by software to decrypt a code). The async may also use this ability to more easily learn new languages, reducing the training time by half.

Predictive Boost
Psi Type: Passive
Action: Automatic
Range: Self
Duration: Constant
The Bayesian probability machine features of the async’s brain are boosted by this sleight, enhancing their ability to estimate and predict outcomes of events around them as they unfold in real-time and update those predictions as information changes. In effect, the character has a more intuitive sense for which outcomes are most likely. This grants the character a +10 bonus on any skill tests that involve predicting the outcome of events. It also bolsters the async’s decision-making in combat situations by making the best course of action more clear, and so provides a +1 bonus to Initiative and +10 to Fray Tests.

Qualia
Psi Type: Active
Action: Quick
Range: Self
Duration: Temp (Action Turns)
Strain Mod: –1
The async can temporarily increase their intuitive grasp of things and cognitive performance. In game terms, Intuition and Cognition are raised by 5 for the chosen duration. These boosts to Intuition and Cognition also raise the rating of skills linked to that aptitude. 

Savant Calculation
Psi Type: Passive
Action: Automatic
Range: Self
Duration: Constant
The character possesses an incredible facility with intuitive mathematics. They can do everything from calculate the odds exactly when gambling to predicting precisely where a leaf falling from a tree will land by observing the landscape and local wind currents. The character specializes in calculation involving the activity of complex chaotic systems and so can calculate answers that even the fastest computers could not, including things like patterns of rubble distribution from an explosion. However, this mathematic facility is largely intuitive, so the character does not know the equations they are solving, they merely know the solution to the problem. This sleight also provides a +30 modifier to any skill tests involving math (which the character is calculating, not a computer).

Sensory Boost
Psi Type: Active
Action: Quick
Range: Self
Duration: WIL Minutes
Strain Mod: –2
An async uses this sleight to increase their natural or augmented sensory perception (sight, audio, smell, augmented) by enhanced cerebral processing, granting a +20 bonus modifier on sensory-based Perception Tests.

Superior Kinesics
Psi Type: Passive
Action: Automatic
Range: Self
Duration: Constant
The async acquires more insight into people’s emotive signals, gestures, facial expressions, and body language when it comes time to predict the person’s emotional state, intent, or reactions. Apply a +10 modifier to Kinesics Skill Tests.

Time Sense
Psi Type: Active
Action: Automatic
Range: Self
Duration: Constant
An async with this ability can slow down his perception of time, making everything appear to move in slow motion or at reduced speed. In game terms, this sleight grants the async a Speed of +1. This extra Action Phase, however, can only be spent on mental and mesh actions.

Unconscious Lead
Psi Type: Active
Action: Automatic
Range: Self
Duration: Sustained
Strain Mod: +0 SV
This sleight allows the async to override their consciousness and let their unconscious mind take point. While in this state, the async’s conscious mind is only dimly aware of what is transgressing, and any memories of this period will be hazy at best. The advantage is that the unconscious mind acts more quickly, and so the async’s Speed is boosted by +1, REF is boosted by +10, and Initiative is boosted by +1. The character remains aware and active, but is incapable of complex communication or other mental actions and is motivated by instinct and primitive urges more than conscious thought. Though it is recommended that the player retain control of their character while using Unconscious Lead, the gamemaster should feel free to direct the character’s actions as they see fit.

Xeno-Empathy
Psi Type: Active
Action: Complex
Range: Self
Duration: Instant
Strain Mod: –1
An async with this sleight can attempt to gain an intuitive understanding of any non-human, non-terrestrial organism. If the character succeeds in an INT x 2 Test, they gain insight into the target’s motivations, needs, and mental/emotional state (if sapient) or the target’s ecological niche, instinctual drives, and likely behavioral responses (if non-sapient). Apply a +20 modifier to any Animal Handling, Deception, Intimidation, Kinesics, or Persuasion Tests made by the character against that organism. This sleight does not work on animals or smart animals of terrestrial origin.

Psi Gamma Sleights
Psi-gamma sleights deal with contacting (reading and communicating) and influencing the function of biological minds (egos within a biomorph, but also including animal life). Psi-gamma is only available to characters with Level 2 of the Psi trait. Most psi-gamma use is handled as an Opposed Test between the async and the target.

Disrupt Proprioception
Psi Type: Active
Action: Complex
Range: Touch
Duration: Temp (WIL x 2 Minutes)
Strain Mod: +0
Skill: Psi Control
Disrupt Proprioception is an offensive sleight that create a sense of disconnection between an ego and its morph—similar to that experienced when resleeved into a new body. The ego finds their body cumbersome, strange, and alien, almost like they are a prisoner within it. If the async beats the target in an Opposed Test, treat the test as a failed Integration Test for the target. This effect lasts for the sleight’s duration. Excellent Success now explicitly doubles penalty and a crit doubles duration.

Aphasic Touch
Psi Type: Active
Action: Complex
Range: Touch
Duration: Temp (WIL/2 Minutes)
Strain Mod: +0
Skill: Control
With a touch attack, the async temporarily blocks or scrambles the language-processing centers in the target’s brain. For the duration of the effect, the target cannot speak, initiate mesh actions, or otherwise communicate or read.

Charisma
Psi Type: Active
Action: Quick
Range: Touch
Duration: Temp (WIL x 2 Minutes)
Strain Mod: –1
Skill: Control
The async uses this sleight to influence the target’s mind on a subconscious level, so that the target perceives them to be charming, magnetic, and persuasive. If the async beats the target in an Opposed Test, they gain a +30 modifier on all subsequent Social Skill Tests for the chosen duration.

Cloud Memory
Psi Type: Active
Action: Complex
Range: Touch
Duration: Temp (WIL Minutes)
Strain Mod: –1
Skill: Control
Cloud Memory allows the async to temporarily disrupt the target’s ability to form long-term memories. If the async wins the Opposed Test, the target’s memory-saving ability is negated for the duration. The target will retain short-term memories during this time, but will soon forget anything that occurred while this sleight was in effect. XP Recordings clouded as well.

Deep Scan
Psi Type: Active
Action: Complex
Range: Touch
Duration: Sustained
Strain Mod: +1
Skill: Sense
Deep Scan is a more intrusive version of Thought Browse (See Below), made to extract information from the targeted individual. If the Opposed Test succeeds, the async telepathically invades the target’s mind and can probe it for information. For every 10 full points of MoS the async achieves on their test, they retrieve one piece of information. Each item takes one full Action Turn to retrieve, during which the sleight must be sustained. The target is aware of this mental probing, though they will not know what information the async acquired.

Drive Emotion
Psi Type: Active
Action: Complex
Range: Touch
Duration: Temp (WIL Minutes)
Strain Mod: –1
Skill: Control
This sleight allows the async to stimulate cortical areas of the target’s brain related to emotion. This allows the async to induce, amplify, or tone down specific emotions, thereby manipulating the target. If the async beats the target in an Opposed Test, they will act in accordance with the emotion for the duration and under certain circumstances may suffer from certain penalties (up to +/–30), as determined by the gamemaster. For example, an async might receive a +30 Intimidation Test modifier against a target imbued with fear.

Ego Sense
Psi Type: Active
Action: Complex
Range: WIL Meters
Duration: Temp (WIL Minutes)
Strain Mod: –1
Skill: Sense
Ego Sense can be used to detect the presence and location of other sentient and biological life forms (i.e., egos) within the async’s range. To detect these life forms, the async makes a single Sense Test, opposed by each life form within range. The async may suffer a modifier for detecting small animals and insects, similar to the modifier applied for targeting them in ranged combat; likewise, a modifier for detecting larger life forms may also be applied. If successful, the async has detected that the life form is nearby. Every 10 full points of MoS will ascertain another piece of information regarding the detected life: direction from async, approximate size, type of creature, distance from async, etc. The async will know if the target moves, if they do so during the sleight’s duration.

Empathic Scan
Psi Type: Active
Action: Quick
Range: WIL/2 Meters
Duration: Temp (WIL Minutes)
Strain Mod: –2
Skill: Sense
Empathic Scan enables the async to sense the target’s base emotions. If the async wins the Opposed Test, they intuitively feel the target’s emotional current state for as long as the sleight is sustained. At the gamemaster’s discretion, this knowledge may provide a modifier (up to +30) for certain Social skill tests.

Implant Memory
Psi Type: Active
Action: Complex
Range: Touch
Duration Instant
Strain Mod: +0
Skill: Control
An async using this sleight can implant a memory of up to an hour’s length inside the target’s mind. This memory very obviously does not belong to the target—there is no way they will confuse it for one of their own. The intent is not to fake memories, but to place one of the async’s memories in the target’s mind so that the target can access it just like any other memory. This can be useful for “archiving” important data with an ally, providing a literal alternate perspective, or simply making a “data dump” for the target to peruse. Implant Memory requires an Opposed Test against unwilling participants. At the gamemaster’s discretion, particularly traumatic memories might inflict mental stress on the recipient.

Implant Skill
Psi Type: Active
Action: Complex
Range: Touch
Duration: Temp (WIL/5 Hours)
Strain Mod: +0
Skill: Control
Similar to Implant Memory, this sleight allows the async to impart some of their expertise and implant it into the target’s mind. For the duration of the sleight, the target benefits when using that skill. If the async’s skill is between 31 and 60, the target receives a +10 bonus. If the async’s skill is 61+, the target receives a +20 bonus. Implant Skill requires an Opposed Test against unwilling participants. In some cases, the target has been known to use the skill with the async’s flair and mannerisms.

Mimic
Psi Type: Active
Action: Quick
Range: Close
Duration: Instant
Strain Mod: +0
Skill: Sense
In a setting where changing your body and face is not unusual, people learn to recognize habits and personality quirks more often. The async must use this sleight on a target and succeed in a Success Test. If successful, the async acquires an “imprint” of the target’s mind that they can take advantage of when impersonating that ego. The async then receives a +30 bonus on Impersonation Tests when mimicking the target’s behavior and social cues.

Mindlink (CHANGE LATER)
Psi Type: Active
Action: Quick
Range: Touch
Duration: Sustained
Strain Mod: +1/target after ﬁrst
Skill: Control
Mindlink allows two-way mental communication with a target. This may be used on more than one target simultaneously, in which case the async can act as a telepathic “server,” so that everyone mindlinked with the async may also telepathically communicate with each other (via the async, however, so they overhear). Language is still a factor in mindlinked communications, but this barrier may be overcome by transmitting sounds, images, emotions, and other sensations. Mindlink requires an Opposed Test against unwilling participants.

Omni Awareness
Psi Type: Active
Action: Quick
Range: WIL x 2 Meters
Duration: Temp (WIL/10 Hours)
Strain Mod: –1
Skill: Sense
An async with Omni Awareness is hypersensitive to other biological life that is observing them. During this sleight’s duration, the async makes a Sense Test that is opposed by any life that has focused their attention on them within the sleight’s range; if successful, the async knows they are being watched, but not by whom or what. It does, however, apply a +30 Perception bonus to spot the observer. This sleight does not register partial attention or fleeting attention, or simple perception of the async, it only notices targets who are actively observing (even if they are concealing their observation). This sleight is effective in spotting a tail, as well as finding potential mates in a bar.

Penetration
Psi Type: Active
Action: Automatic
Range: Touch
Duration: Instant
Strain Mod: 1 per AP point beyond 3
Skill: Psi Control
Penetration is a sleight that works in conjunction with any offensive sleight that involves the Psi Control skill. It allows the async to penetrate the Psi Shield of an opponent by concentrating their psi attack. Adds 3 AP base to the attack, and up to the async's Psi Control, divided by 10, additional AP. Further, reduces the target's defence by (WIL/2) 

Mental Bulwark
Psi Type: Passive
Action: Automatic
Range: Self
Duration: Constant
Psi Shield bolsters the async’s mind to psi attack and manipulation. If the async is hit by a psi attack, they receive WIL ÷ 5 (round up) points of armor, reducing the amount of damage inflicted. They also receive a +10 modifier when resisting any other sleights and mental manipulations, including coercion, torture, and psychosurgery. Can be learned an additional time, stacking the effect.

Psychic Stab
Psi Type: Active
Action: Complex
Range: Touch
Duration: Instant
Strain Mod: +0, SV
Skill: Psi Control
Psychic Stab is an offensive sleight that seeks to inflict physical damage on the target’s brain and nervous system. Each successful attack inflicts 2d10 + (WIL ÷ 10, round up) damage. Increase the damage by +5 if an Excellent Success is scored, and +10 with 60+ MoS.

Scramble
Psi Type: Passive
Action: Automatic
Range: Self
Duration: Constant
Scramble allows the async using the sleight to hide from another async using the Ego Sense or Omni Awareness sleights. Apply a +30 modifier to the defending async’s Opposed Test.

Sense Block
Psi Type: Active
Action: Complex
Range: Touch
Duration: Temp (WIL/2 Minutes)
Strain Mod: –1, +1 per additional sense
Skill: Psi Control
Sense Block disables and short circuits one of the target’s sensory cortices (chosen by the async), interfering with and possibly negating a specific source of sensory input for the chosen duration. If the async beats the target in the Opposed Test, the target suffers a –30 modifier to Perception Tests with that sense equal (doubled to –60 if the async scores an Excellent Success, completely negating the sense on a sense).

Sense Infection
Psi Type: Active
Action: Complex
Range: WIL Meters
Duration: Instant
Strain Mod: –1
Skill: Sense
The async may determine whether a target is infected with a biological nanovirus or nanoplague strain of the exsurgent virus with a Sense Test. If successful, the character automatically knows if the target is an async. Other strains of the virus may, at the gamemaster’s discretion, provide a foreboding of their modus operandi. In no case is the name of the strain revealed (strains are named by Firewall, not by themselves), but research or inquiries with the Eye might allow the character to identify the feeling they get with a known, named strain.

Static
Psi Type: Active
Action: Complex
Range: Close
Duration: Sustained
Strain Mod: +0
Skill: None
The async generates an anti-psi jamming field, impeding any use of ranged sleights within their range. All such ranged sleights suffer a –30 modifier. This sleight has no effect on self or touch-range sleights.

Subliminal
Psi Type: Active
Action: Complex
Range: Touch
Duration: Instant
Strain Mod: +2
Skill: Control
The Subliminal sleight allows the async to influence the train of thought of another person by implementing a single post-hypnotic suggestion into the mind of the target. If the async wins the Opposed Test, the recipient will carry out this suggestion as if it was their own idea. Implanted suggestions must be short and simple; as a rule of thumb, the gamemaster may only accept suggestions encompassed by a short sentence (for example: “open the airlock,” or “hand over the weapon”). At the gamemaster’s discretion, the target may receive a bonus for resisting suggestions that are immediately life threatening (“jump off the bridge”) or that violate their motivations or personal strictures. Suggestions do not need to be carried out immediately, they may be implanted with a short trigger condition (“when the alarm goes off, ignore it”).

Thought Browse is a less-intrusive form of mind reading which scans the target’s surface thoughts for certain “keywords” like a particular word, phrase, sound, or image chosen by the async. Rather than digging through the target’s ego as with the Deep Scan sleight, Thought Browse merely verifies whether a target has a particular person, place, event, or thing in mind, which can be used by a savvy investigator to draw conclusions without the need to invade the mind directly. Thought Browse may be sustained, allowing the async to continue scanning the target’s thoughts over time. The async must beat the target in an Opposed Test for each action turn.
