Critical fray

	Critical success in fray rolls in melee allows the defender to gain +10 on their next hit.

-Melee-

Feinting:
	
	Characters fighting in close combat may attempt to make their strike more
	difficult to avoid. The attacker may "feint" as a Called Shot to force the
	defender to use 3/4 of their Fray or Melee combat skill to defend against the
	attack roll.  This makes the attacker subject to a -10 penalty to their attack,
	as per Called Shot rules (EP, p.197).  Feinting requires a Quick Action to
	execute the necessary footwork required to confound the opponent.

Extra Melee Weapons:

	In the use of two or more melee weapons, the first weapon attacks as normal, the second at a -20 penalty, and subsequent attacks at -30, -40, -50 etc.
	Armor reduces damage before the calculation is make.
	Attack # | Damage modifier
	   1     | 1
	   2     | 1/2

Weapon Sets:
	
	Melee weapons which could be used as a set such as gloves are purchased as single items, and using more than one counts as using multiple weapons.

Disengaging:

	Moving out of melee range is a Quick Action, with the person trying to
	escape rolling Fray/Freerunning-20 vs the others Melee skill. If you fail,
	you not only don't go anywhere, but you take a free hit at half damage from
	the person you were trying to get away from.

	You can make it a complex action instead of a Quick Action to remove the
	-20 penalty without oppurtunity for a return attack.

Cumbersome Gear Rating:
	
	Some weapons have a -30 to hit if not properly braced.
	Aiming with Quick Action removes this penalty.
	Aiming with a complex action gives the next shot a +20 to hit.

Aiming

	You cannot aim ranged weapons in melee range.

Melee Weaponry:

Melee weapons have come a long way from their antecedents. Built of smart
materials and often containing dedicated AIs and sensor suites, modern melee
weapons can be more aptly described as weaponized disassembly systems, capable
of analysing whatever they're swung at and modifying themselves to maximize
their effectiveness.

Melee Weapons are available in three categories defined by their size, with
each category available in bladed, blunt or complex forms. The effects of each
weapon are defined by their category, as the advanced technologies they use
render their effects in combat roughly equivalent – their exact physical forms
are irrelevant, and largely a function of aesthetics. If desired, they can form
an internal canister to hold chemicals, drugs or nanobots, which can be set to
release either on contact or when the target is damaged.

	Light Weapons

		Weapons which fall in the “Light” category are generally small or
		simple, and many carry at least one on their person.
		Knives are the most usual example of Light Bladed Weapons, and Light
		Blunt Weapons include small clubs and the batons carried by security
		forces. Light Complex Weapons usually take the form of smartmaterial
		clothing, such as self-hardening gloves, shoe spikes or bladed
		hat-rims.

		Armor Penetration (AP): 0 Damage Value (DV): 1d10 + (SOM/10) Average
		DV: 5 + (SOM/10) Cost: [Trivial] Palming tests to conceal Light weapons
		get a +20 bonus. When making an attack with a Light weapon the wielder
		gains either a +10 bonus to hit, or may increase the DV by 1d10.

	Standard Weapons

		What one usually thinks of when picturing melee weaponry, Standard
		weapons are wielded with one-hand. Standard Bladed weapons include
		sabres, rapiers and hatchets, whilst hammers and maces make up the bulk
		of Standard Blunt weapons. Whips and chains are the most popular forms
		of Standard Complex weapon, often equipped with systems similar to
		those found in electronic rope to prevent self-injury.

		Armor Penetration (AP): -2 Damage Value (DV): 2d10 + 2 + (SOM/10)
		Average DV 13 + (SOM/10) Cost: [Trivial] When making an attack with a
		Standard weapon the wielder gains either a +10 bonus to hit, or may
		increase the DV by 1d10.

	Heavy Weapons

		Heavy weapons are large weapons which must be wielded with two hands.
		Longswords and Claymores are popular versions of the Heavy Bladed
		category, and most habitats will have Heavy Axes available for fire or
		emergency purposes. Heavy Blunt weapons such as hammers can often be
		found in the hands of gang enforcers to make them more intimidating,
		and staves are beloved by those who take a more mystical or spiritual
		approach to transhuman existence.
		Heavy Complex weapons are exceedingly rare, the most notorious of which
		being the smart-fibre garrotte.

		Armor Penetration (AP): -6 Damage Value (DV): 2d10 +6 + (SOM/10)
		Average DV: 15 + (SOM/10) Cost: [Trivial] When making an attack with a
		Heavy weapon the wielder gains either a +10 bonus to hit, or may
		increase the DV by 1d10. Characters attempting to use Heavy weapons
		with one hand do not get this bonus.

Modifications: Almost all modern melee weapons are equipped with at least one
of the following modifications, and it isn't uncommon for a weapon to possess
more, although such weapons are usually found in the hands of specialists. To
determine the price of a modified weapon, simply add the cost of the weapon and
modifications together. The cost of the weapon's blueprint is determined in the
same manner.

	Non-lethal: These weapons are not intended to cause serious injury, and are
	often used a training implement or in sports. Non-lethal weapons with other
	modifications are often used by Security personnel or for self-defence.
	Non-lethal weapons gain -4 AP, but halve any damage dealt. [Trivial]

	Flex: The smartmaterials in this weapon are programmed to shift it's form to
	something more innocuous when activated, such such as a piece of clothing or
	briefcase. Activating this modification requires a Quick Action, which can be
	combined with the action to draw or holster the weapon. Security personnel and
	weapon scanners can only identify the true nature of these weapons if they
	score a critical success on a perception check. [Low]

	Mono-filament: Weapons with this modification are either honed to a
	monomolecular edge or have their striking surface covered with a
	monofilament mesh, easily capable of slicing through metal or limbs. Such
	weapons gain +2 AP, +2 DV, and attack rolls which score an Excellent Success
	automatically bypass armour. [Moderate]

	Vibro-: This modification equips the weapon with edged surfaces which vibrate
	at a high frequency for extra cutting ability. This has little extra effect
	when stabbing or slashing, but when carefully sawing through something or
	applying constant pressure with a blunt weapon, this provides an extra –3 AP
	and +2d10 damage. [Moderate]

	Shock: Weapons with this modification Shock targets they damage. (See EP. p204)
	[Moderate]

	Shredder: The smart materials in these weapons are programmed to reform into
	serrated barbs once the target has been struck to tear apart flesh and metal,
	then retract to ease retrieval. Attacks which deal damage deal an extra 1d10
	DV. [High]

	Render: This combination of the Vibro- and Shredder modifications was developed
	to attack armour, inducing fractures and tearing away nearby material. When
	this weapon strikes it's target it reduces it's kinetic armour value by 1d10/2.
	[Moderate]

	Plasma-Sheath: When activated this modification cloaks the weapon in a softly
	glowing plasma shell. Essentially an inbuilt bug-zapper, this plasma is much
	too weak to harm most morphs, but makes an effective countermeasure against
	nanoswarms.. Attacks made against nanoswarms or morphs with the Swarm
	Composition augmentation deal 1d10 DV, instead of the 1 DV usually dealt.
	[Moderate]

FIRING MODES AND RATE OF FIRE
	Every ranged weapon in Eclipse Phase comes with one or more  ring modes that determines their rate of  re. These  ring modes are detailed below.

	SINGLE SHOT (SS)
	Single shot weapons may only be  red once per Complex Action. These are typically larger or more archaic devices.

	SEMI-AUTOMATIC (SA)
	Semi-automatic weapons are capable of quick, repeated  re. They may be  red twice with the same Complex Action. Each shot is handled as a separate attack.

	BURST FIRE (BF)
	Burst fired weapons release a number of quick shots (a “burst”) with a single trigger pull. Two bursts maybe fired with the same Complex Action. Each burst is handled as a separate attack. Bursts use up 3 shots worth of ammunition.
	A burst may be shot against a single target or against two targets who are standing within one meter of each other. In the case of concentrated fired against a single target, the attacker gains a +10 modifier to hit and increases the DV by +1d10.

	FULL AUTOMATIC (FA)
	Normal pistols dont get FA.
	Full-auto weapons release a hail of shots with a single trigger pull. Only one full-auto attack may be made with each Complex Action. This attack may be made on a single target or against up to three separate targets, as long as each is within one meter of another. In the case of concentrated  re on a single individual, the attacker can choose either a +30 modi er to hit or increase the DV by +3d10. Firing in full automatic mode uses up 10 shots.
