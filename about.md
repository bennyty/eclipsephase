My name is Benjamin Espey and I am a sophomore at Rensselaer Polytechnic studying Computer Science. I am excited about the future of technology, scientific discovery, and artificial intelligence / machine learning. This website is a collection of my projects, thoughts, and materials I find interesting.

## Setup

Some fun facts about the setup of this website include:

* Built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com/)
* Developed on GitHub and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* Coded with [vim](http://www.openvim.com/), the largest editing speed improvement ever. Seriously, the command **ci)** (change inside parenthesis) alone has saved so much time.

Have questions, suggestions, or a job (please)? Feel free to [email me.](mailto:benjamin.espey@gmail.com)
